This repository contains the implementation of the methods described in:

*Joint background removal and denoising of complex features in ultrafast nonlinear Raman spectroscopy via deep learning*
-reference coming soon-

## Usage
The script `SRSdenois_main.ipynb` contains minimal implementation examples for loading the two datasets provided in `Datasets`, training the NN and testing the pretrained NNs provided in `Weights` on unseen examples from the datasets.

The script `metrics_2.py` in `Models` contains python implementations of the edge finder and the custom metrics described in the paper.

`Weights/weights_readme.md` and `Datasets/Datasets_readme` contain additional information on the pretrained networks and the datasets. Please refer to the main text and supplementary information of the article for further details.
